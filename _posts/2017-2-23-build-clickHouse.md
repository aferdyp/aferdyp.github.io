Instructions to build ClickHouse on Centos 7

The folks over at ClickHouse have some instructions to build binaries for Debian [here](https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse/blob/master/doc/build.md). If you need build a rpm, you can follow the steps mentioned [here](https://github.com/redsoftbiz/clickhouse-rpm).

This note is meant for those who simply need to get ClickHouse running on Centos 7 without the explicit need to get rpms in place.
